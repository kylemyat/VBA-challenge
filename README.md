# VBA-challenge
Challenge 2

In this challenge I used nested loops and For statements to summarize annual performance data of vaarious stocks. 
The summarized data includes the ticker symbol, yearly change, percent change, total stock volume, stock of greatest percentage increase, stock of greatest percetnage decrease, and total stock volume.

Lines 4 to 7 is a loop which applies the rest of the code to each worksheet.
The following resources were used for the understanding and implementation of a loop through worksheets in the workbook:
